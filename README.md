# User Experience UX

<br>

 ## Wireframes
 
  The wireframes for the website were produced in Balsamiq. There are frames for a full width display. The final site varies  from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

<br>
<br>

* Home Page
<br>

# Site Structure

<br>

<p> The website has three pages. The home page is the default loading page, gallery and contact us pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another page called thank you that users only see when they submit a form query. </p>

**[Back to top](<#contents>)**

<br>
<br>

# Design Choices

<br>

 ## Typography
 <p> The fonts chosen were 'Monsterrat' for the headings and 'Lato' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. </p>

  * 'Monsterrat' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel.
  * 'Lato' is used for the body text as it goes along nicely with the headings whilst being easy to read for all.

<br>

 ## Colour Scheme

  <p> The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on black, dark blue, whitesmoke, cyan, light blue, red and orange.
      The black colour contrasts with the rest of the images and it is an easy color to read. Dark blue colour is associated with 
      the swimmer's competitive gear. Cyan colour was used to catch the user's eye and to draw their attention to the contact page. The light blue, red and orange were used for contrast between the different social media sites and easier for the user to get engaged with the club.

This website was developed and designed as a Portfolio 1 Project for Full Stack Software Developer Diploma course at the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I would like to thank my mentor Marcel Mulders, our facilitator Chris Quinn, the Slack community, and all at the Code Institute for their help and support. I really enjoyed working on this project as I have great interest in swimming, which the website is about.
